### 👋🏼 Hey, I'm Padam

I love building consumer software. Currently building Android at [Jupiter](jup.ag). Previously worked as the founding Android engineer for [Naval](https://x.com/naval) and [Brian](https://x.com/BrianNorgard)'s startup [Airchat](https://x.com/getairchat), and other places like 1Password, theScore, etc.

I graduated from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) with a Bachelor's in Computer Science 💻 in 2023.
